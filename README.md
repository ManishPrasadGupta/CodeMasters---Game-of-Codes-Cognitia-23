# CodeMasters---Game-of-Codes-Cognitia-23

We are team CodeMasters in the Game of Codes event of Cognitia'23, NIT Meghalaya and we have created a simple snake game using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The name of our game is "The Snake's Pursuit" and its features include:
1. A beautiful snake has been created which grows in size as it eats food.
2. A sound is played whenever the snake eats food which makes our game different.
3. A background music has been added which makes the game more fun and interesting.
4. A toggle button has been provided to turn the background music on or off in case someone doesn't want the background music.
5. A username field has been added to take input of user's name.
6. The game doesn't start if the username field is left empty, that is, the username field is mandatory.
7. A reset game button has been provided to reset the game at any given moment.
8. A leaderboard has been created to display the top scores of the current session.
9. The user's name is entered in the leaderboard if he/she beats the current high score.
10. The score of the current ongoing game and the high score of the current session is displayed at all times on the screen.
